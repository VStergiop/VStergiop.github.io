I received my diploma in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](http://www.ece.upatras.gr/index.php/en/) from the University of Patras, Greece, in 2018. Currently, 
I am a 3rd year PhD student in the [Morpheme team](https://team.inria.fr/morpheme/), at the [I3S laboratory](https://www.i3s.unice.fr/en) in Sophia-Antipolis, France.

I work on inverse problems in imaging and more particularly on super-resolution in optical microscopy.
