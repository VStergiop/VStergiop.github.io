I received my diploma in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](http://www.ece.upatras.gr/index.php/en/) from the University of Patras, Greece, in 2018. Currently, 
I am a 3rd year PhD student in the [Morpheme team](https://team.inria.fr/morpheme/) (Inria, CNRS, UCA) under the supervision of [Laure Blanc-Féraud](https://www.i3s.unice.fr/~blancf/), [Luca Calatroni](https://sites.google.com/view/lucacalatroni) and Sébastien Schaub.

I work on inverse problems in imaging with a particular focus on super-resolution in optical microscopy.
